# Single-Cycle-ARM-CPU
#### Description
This projects impliments a Single-Cycle ARMV4 CPU onto an Intel DE10 FPGA. The processor impliments a Harvard architecture and supports all standard ARM assembly operations besides division (see control.xls for details). The processor impliments the five stage CPU architecture (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back).
